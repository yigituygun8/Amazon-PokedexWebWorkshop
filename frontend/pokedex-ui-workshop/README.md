# Amazon Pokedex Web Workshop

Welcome to the Amazon Pokedex Web Workshop! This project was developed as part of the **University Engagement Program**, an educational and mentorship initiative founded in 2021 by **Alba Mustafaj**, and powered by the volunteer efforts of Amazonians globally in partnership with the **Amazon Women in Engineering (AWE)** community.

## 🌍 About the University Engagement Program

The University Engagement Program is a global initiative focused on empowering university students — particularly young women and individuals from underrepresented communities — by offering:

- Hands-on training in in-demand software engineering skills
- Real-world project experience
- Mentorship opportunities from Amazon engineers

Originally piloted at the **American University of Beirut**, the program has grown to include students from various regions and backgrounds. The current format features an intensive **3-day Software Engineering Bootcamp**.
